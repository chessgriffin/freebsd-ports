Simple Scan is an easy-to-use gui scanning application, designed to let users
connect their scanner and quickly have the image or document scanned in an
appropriate format.  Simple Scan is essentially a front-end to SANE, which is
the same backend used by XSANE.  This means that all existing scanners that
function with XSANE should also work with Simple Scan.
